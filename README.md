*Your AI-powered GitHub Repository Analyzer*

## 🧩 Problem  

Developers and teams often struggle to **understand large or unfamiliar GitHub repositories quickly**.  
Manually checking commits, exploring file changes, or figuring out what’s happening inside a new repo can be:  
- Time-consuming ⏳  
- Hard to summarize 🧠  
- Confusing when multiple contributors are involved 🤯  

There’s no easy way to ask —  
> “What did this commit change?”  
> “Can you create me a SaaS application?”  
> “What are the llm models used in this repo?.”
> "What are the tickets discussed in the meetings?"
